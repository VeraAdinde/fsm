# Finite State Machine Designer (Updated)

Original: http://madebyevan.com/fsm/

Note: This repo is technically forked, but I realized that the currently published version of the designer was different than the most recent github version, so I pulled the code from the site, sorted it into a few files, and put it here.

Since we frequently use this FSM builder for CSE 132, I've made a few updates to make it easier to use.

- Clear canvas button was added (from https://github.com/evanw/fsm/pull/6)
- Extra instructions added for adding and deleting items
- Added another method (shift-backspace) for deleting states & arrows
- Fixed the broken PNG export function (from https://github.com/evanw/fsm/pull/11)
